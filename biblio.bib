abstract="We consider the problem of supporting several different path queries over a tree on n nodes, each having a weight drawn from a set of $\sigma$ distinct values, where $\sigma${\thinspace}â‰¤{\thinspace}n. One query we support is the path median query, which asks for the median weight on a path between two given nodes. For this and the more general path selection query, we present a linear space data structure that answers queries in                                                                           {\$}O({\backslash}lg {\backslash}sigma){\$}                 time under the word RAM model. This greatly improves previous results on the same problem, as previous data structures achieving                                                                           {\$}O({\backslash}lg n){\$}                 query time use                                                                           {\$}O(n {\backslash}lg^2 n){\$}                 space, and previous linear space data structures require O(n                                  $\epsilon$                ) time to answer a query for any positive constant $\epsilon$ [16]. Our linear space data structure also supports path counting queries in                                                                           {\$}O({\backslash}lg {\backslash}sigma){\$}                 time. This matches the result of Chazelle [8] when $\sigma$ is close to n, but has better performance when $\sigma$ is significantly smaller than n. Finally, the same data structure can also support path reporting queries in                                                                           {\$}O({\backslash}lg {\backslash}sigma + occ {\backslash}lg {\backslash}sigma){\$}                 time, where occ is the size of output. In addition, we present a data structure that answers path reporting queries in                                                                           {\$}O({\backslash}lg {\backslash}sigma + occ {\backslash}lg{\backslash}lg{\backslash}sigma){\$}                 time, using                                                                           {\$}O(n{\backslash}lg{\backslash}lg{\backslash}sigma){\$}                 space. These are the first data structures that answer path reporting queries.",
